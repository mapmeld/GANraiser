## Concept

What if independent GANs were funded through continuous community
crowdfunding? How I see it working:

- The community votes up/down GAN proposals, and every 3 weeks, the top project receives compute time.
- Prospective GAN-runners submit their proposal, with proof that they have a usable dataset, code, and interesting output. There could be a ~$20 fee to guarantee that the community isnâ€™t flooded with sloppy applications.
- Community members donate $ or compute time into a pool, and this affects the weight of their vote (weighting capped at $100/user, $2,000/org to avoid GAN-runners using the vote to subsidize their own project).
